# Mystery_Detective_Game_Text_Based
This project utilizes different classes to portray a murder mystery experience through text.
Project was worked on by: Myself (Jeremy Thummel), David Cacorovski, Sohail Meghani

My main contribution to this project is the most important. It is typical for mystery styled adventure games to give the user
the ability to view aspects of a scene and analyze clues in an area. I developed a class that would provide a UI for the user
and create a scene for the user to analyze. This class however only needs strings to identify the name of the clues,
and descriptions of each clue. The class takes care of the user input, and program output etc. This is useful since
I can create an object of this class to easily create mystery scenes for the user to play through.
